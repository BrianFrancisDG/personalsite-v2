        I'm Software Engineer that loves for front-end development and 
        technologies. My current adventure has me focusing on C#, 
        JavaScript, .NET MVC, HTML, CSS, JQuery. 
        I am also familiar with Restful APIs and Agile Framework. 
        I'm currently teaching myself the basics of modern JavaScript 
        frameworks with Angular so watch my GitHub for an upcoming 
        project. I'm constantly tinkering loving how programming allows me
        to be both technical and creative.
