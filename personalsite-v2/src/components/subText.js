        I'm Software Engineer that loves for front-end development and 
        technologies. My current adventure has me focusing on <b>C#, 
        JavaScript, .NET MVC, HTML, CSS, JQuery</b>. 
        I'm currently teaching myself the basics of modern JavaScript 
        frameworks with <b>Angular and React</b> so watch my GitHub for an upcoming 
        project. I'm constantly tinkering loving how programming allows me
        to be both technical and creative.
